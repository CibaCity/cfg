snd_mixahead 0.05									// Sets how long it takes until attack sounds play. By default the setting is 0.1, or 100ms, which is 1/10 of a second.

mat_alphacoverage 0                 							// Reduces shader complexity for some transparent materials.

mat_forcemanagedtextureintohardware 0							//
mat_trilinear 1 									// Sets trlinear mode.
//mat_viewportscale 1 									// Defaults to 1 already. Lowers pixel density, but it's better to just lower resolution.

mp_decals 9 										// '9' is a good value to still see the spread pattern from a scattergun without any real performance loss. Needs to be changed with r_decals.

r_waterdrawreflection 1									// Controls as to whether reflections should be drawn on the surface of water.
r_waterdrawrefraction 1									// Setting to 0 makes it so that water looks weird and you can't look into it, but it might have an FPS gain.

rope_averagelight 0									// Makes ropes use average of cubemap lighting instead of max intensity.
rope_collide 0										// Collide rope with the world.

rope_subdiv 0										// Rope subdivision amount.

r_fastzreject -1 	  	 							// Values >1 enable a fast Z rejection algorithm, to be performed on the GPU (as opposed to on the CPU). The value `-1' autodetects hardware support for this feature, which is safer than forcing it.
